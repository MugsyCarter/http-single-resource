This is a single resourse http server.

you can access it by typing 'node server.js' and then navigating to localhost:8080 in your browser.

It allows users to enter world capitals in the page and also retrieve a persistent list of world capitals.

When a user enters a country and a capital, that information is then permanently appended to countryData.json in the data folder.

Just opening the page and not entering data will just give you a list of all the currently entered captials.

TODO
1) Fix any "+"s in the entries
2) clean up the json input
