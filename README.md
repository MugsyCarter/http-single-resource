This is a single resourse http server.

It allows users to enter world capitals in the page and also retrieve a persistent list of world capitals.

When a user enters a country and a capital, that information is then permanently appended to countryData.json in the data folder.

Just opening the page and not entering data will just give you a list of all the current entered captials.
